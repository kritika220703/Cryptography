# Cryptography

Implemented two cryptographic algorithms: RSA nad SHA-256

# RSA Algorithm:
It is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm which make use of two keys: public key for encryption and private key for decryption.

In RSA, we have implemented encryption and decryption of numbers and text.

# SHA-256 Algorithm:
It is a cryptographic hashing algorithm which converts any input message into a 256-bit hash value.

In SHA-256, we have implemented 256-bits Hash value generation and current datetime-based 6-digit OTP Generation.
